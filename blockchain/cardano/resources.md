- https://developers.cardano.org/ As a rule of thumb (and unfortunately): avoid http://docs.cardano.org as it is often inaccurate, plain wrong or missing crucial elements. On the other hand, the Cardano Developer Portal is a good entry point to many of the ecosystem tooling and resources. The "Builder Tools" section is particularly furnished. It is community-maintained, curated and under constant evolution. Feel free to contribute and ask questions there as well!
