## How To Create LXC Template?

Every time inspiration struck or I saw a blog post with something I wanted to try, it was frustrating and time consuming to get the base operating system set up to the way I like it before proceeding with the project.

Now I just update the template each point release or when I add something substantial to my dotfiles so it's ready to go whenever I need to spin up a fresh container.

It only takes a few minutes to set up or modify and can save lots of time in the long run.
